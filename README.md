# Stock Price Checker

This is the boilerplate for the Stock Price Checker project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-projects/stock-price-checker


This project completed by GGriz, using the above mentioned lessons.

Majority of issues I found were related to the environment being used to test for FCC.

Setting .env manually on Render for testing fixed failing test issues.
